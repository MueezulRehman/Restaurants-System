# CodeIbex Development Focus

## Purpose

This document is the working priority list for the project. Before starting new
features, use this file to decide what must be completed first and to record
whether the current foundation is stable.

## Current Focus

**Stabilize and verify the existing application before adding new features.**

The immediate goal is not to expand the product. The immediate goal is to make
the current admin, manager, authentication, tenancy, and core business flows
reliable enough that future changes can be made safely.

## Work Order

### 1. Establish a clean baseline

- Check the current Git working tree before changing files.
- Reproduce any reported error in the running application.
- Record the affected route, page, browser error, and server error.
- Fix only the root cause of the reported issue.
- Run the smallest relevant syntax, test, or browser verification.

### 2. Stabilize shared application foundations

Prioritize shared code before page-specific improvements:

- Authentication and role authorization.
- Restaurant/tenant resolution and tenant data isolation.
- Admin and manager layout navigation.
- Shared JavaScript initialization.
- Shared Blade components, styles, and form behavior.
- Error handling and validation.

The tenancy rules in
`docs/CODEIBEX_TENANCY_CODING_STANDARD.md` are mandatory. Tenant data must
always be accessed through the established tenancy context.

### 3. Verify the core business flows

After shared foundations are stable, verify these flows end to end:

1. Super admin login and platform dashboard.
2. Business creation and business settings.
3. Manager login and manager dashboard.
4. Module access and role restrictions.
5. Menu/product management.
6. Customer and order flow.
7. Subscription and billing status.
8. Notifications and account settings.

### 4. Improve user experience

Only after the flows above are verified:

- Fix responsive layout problems.
- Improve navigation clarity.
- Remove duplicated or confusing labels.
- Add loading, empty, success, and error states.
- Keep branding and theme behavior consistent between admin and manager areas.

### 5. Add new features

New features may begin only when:

- The affected existing flow has a passing baseline check.
- The feature has a clear route, permission rule, data model, and validation
  plan.
- Tenant boundaries are defined.
- Existing behavior will remain compatible or the behavior change is explicitly
  documented.

## Rules For Every Change

- Read the relevant existing code before editing.
- Search for an existing helper or pattern before creating a new one.
- Keep changes surgical and limited to the requested behavior.
- Do not hide exceptions or silently fall back to success.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Update documentation when behavior or architecture changes.
- Verify the result in the running application when the change affects UI.
- Do not consider a task complete until the expected behavior is verified.

## Definition Of Done

A task is complete only when:

- The requested behavior works.
- Existing related behavior still works.
- Relevant syntax checks, tests, or browser checks pass.
- No new console error is introduced.
- The change follows the tenancy, authorization, and project conventions.
- The result and any remaining limitation are recorded here or in the relevant
  technical documentation.

## Next Action

Before moving to another feature, inspect the current application for remaining
shared-layout and JavaScript errors, fix those root causes, and verify the
admin and manager navigation in the browser.

## Progress Log

### Phase 3 consultation workflow

- Added tenant-scoped consultation endpoints for existing Visits, including
  diagnosis/clinical notes, status updates synchronized with QueueEntry, and
  read-only/printable consultation views.
- Linked prescriptions to Visit, Patient, and Doctor. Prescription creation
  validates tenant ownership and blocks active patient allergy triggers and
  known medicine interactions using the existing allergy/interaction data.
- Added a printable prescription slip. Dispensing, stock deduction, billing,
  SMS, and hospital workflows remain out of scope.

### Completed

- Began Phase 2 queue infrastructure within the approved scope. Added
  tenant-scoped `Visit`, `QueueCounter`, and `QueueEntry` models and central
  plus tenant migrations. Added Manager reception check-in and today's
  per-doctor queue pages with transactional daily token issuance, manual
  `Next`, and guarded status transitions. Verified the focused queue test:
  **1/1 test passing, 12 assertions**. Full Phase 2 workflow and browser
  verification remain pending.
- Added the Phase 2 paper token slip and safe digital token status page.
  Reception now opens a printable slip after check-in, and each queue entry
  receives an unguessable public token. The public page exposes only the
  doctor, token number, date, and queue status; it does not expose patient or
  medical data. Added a regression test covering the public/private boundary:
  **1/1 test passing, 16 assertions**.
- Added appointment-to-Visit reconciliation at medical reception. A
  same-day scheduled/confirmed appointment can now be linked to the selected
  Patient and Doctor when checked in; the appointment receives one Visit and
  one QueueEntry/token only. Repeated check-in of the same appointment is
  rejected, and the public token lookup is constrained to the restaurant
  slug. Browser verification confirmed the Manager queue and check-in pages
  load successfully, including the existing authenticated Test Restaurant
  session.
- Added the read-only kiosk/shared display at
  `/queue-display/{restaurantSlug}`. It auto-refreshes every 10 seconds and
  shows only currently called/in-progress token numbers and doctor names; it
  never exposes patient names, CNICs, phone numbers, or clinical information.
  Added regression coverage for the public display privacy boundary.
- Completed light returning-patient history for authorized Manager users within
  the current tenant. Patient listings now link to a read-only history page
  showing prior visit date, Doctor, specialty, status, and reason with
  pagination; no diagnosis, prescription, vitals, allergies, or editable
  clinical notes are exposed. Tenant isolation and read-only behavior are
  covered by a focused feature test. Browser verification confirmed the
  Patient list and history page render correctly for the authenticated Manager
  session.
- Phase 2 queue work is now complete: appointment reconciliation, printable
  token slips, safe digital token links, kiosk display, and light returning
  history are implemented and verified. Final validation passed:
  **205/205 tests, 786 assertions**, and the Vite production build.

### Medical Module Expansion — Phase 3

- Added the tenant-scoped consultation workflow for existing Visits, including
  diagnosis and clinical notes, explicit plain-string status validation, queue
  status synchronization, tenant-safe visit lookup, and printable consultation
  output.
- Linked prescriptions to `Visit`, `Patient`, and `Doctor` while preserving the
  existing prescription workflow. Prescription creation validates all linked
  records against the current tenant and checks medicine interactions before
  saving.
- Added a separate tenant-scoped `PatientAllergy` model and central/tenant
  migrations. Patient-specific allergy checks are now distinct from the
  retail `CustomerAllergy` workflow.
- Added Manager Patient Allergy CRUD under the medical module, with
  tenant-scoped patient/medicine validation and active-warning management.
- Added focused Phase 3 regression coverage for consultation completion,
  queue synchronization, cross-tenant visit access, PatientAllergy CRUD, and
  prescription allergy/interaction safety. Tenant provisioning and the
  complete suite pass: **209/209 tests, 797 assertions**.
- Phase 3 deliberately does not include pharmacist dispensing, stock
  deduction, billing expansion, SMS, hospital-scope work, or a new permission
  system.

- Fixed the shared admin layout JavaScript initialization error by moving
  `initManagerNavigationGroups()` to module scope in
  `resources/js/super-admin/layout.js`.
- Declared the optional `header` prop in
  `resources/views/components/page/card.blade.php`. This fixed the shared
  component error that caused admin pages to return HTTP 500.
- Migrated POS configuration from deleted `admin.pos.*` view names to the
  current `manager.pos.*` views.
- Added a compatibility alias for the legacy `admin/dashboard` view name.
- Preserved notification compatibility by allowing both GET and POST requests
  for notification read links while current forms continue to use POST.
- Verified the frontend with `npm run build`.
- Verified the focused admin access tests:
  `AdminSuperAdminAccessTest` passes.
- Verified the focused medical POS and manager notification tests.
- Verified the complete feature suite: **183/183 tests passing**.
- Reloaded the admin and manager pages. No current shared-layout JavaScript
  error is reported by the browser.
- Refactored the Sales Returns page to use reusable CSS component classes from
  `resources/css/app.css` instead of page-specific utility-heavy styling.
- Moved the Sales Returns customer filter into
  `resources/js/pages/sales-returns.js`, loaded through the main asset bundle.
- Confirmed the Sales Returns page responds with HTTP 200 and renders the
  extracted classes in the browser.
- Re-ran the complete feature suite after the refactor: **183/183 tests
  passing**.
- Removed model queries, tenancy resolution, theme assembly, notification
  queries, and role navigation setup from all four role master views.
- Added dedicated view composers for the dashboard, customer, and CEO layout
  contracts. The manager and super-admin masters share
  `DashboardLayoutComposer`; customer and CEO keep separate composers because
  their data and security boundaries are different.
- Registered the composers in `AppServiceProvider`, so layout data is prepared
  only when the relevant master view is rendered instead of being duplicated
  in templates.
- Verified PHP syntax, the Vite production build, the complete feature suite
  (**183/183 tests, 681 assertions**), and live admin/manager browser pages.
- Extracted the duplicated dashboard-shell style block from the manager and
  super-admin masters into `resources/css/layouts.css`.
- Verified the extracted CSS matches the original block byte-for-byte.
- Recompiled Blade views, rebuilt frontend assets, reran the full feature
  suite, and reloaded both admin and manager pages successfully.
- Standardized the customer master contract by rendering
  `@yield('page-content')` inside the shared shell.
- Migrated the standalone customer feedback, menu-empty, no-restaurant, and
  storefront-unavailable pages to extend `customer.layout.master` and place
  their UI inside `@section('page-content')`.
- Confirmed that the remaining non-master role files are intentional login,
  PDF/receipt export, partial, or script views rather than full application
  pages.
- Recompiled all Blade views, rebuilt frontend assets, reloaded the manager
  page, and verified the complete suite still passes (**183/183 tests,
  681 assertions**).
- Added named preset runtime variables for Ocean, Forest, and Sunset so preset
  selection overrides the dashboard variables that are intentionally emitted
  inline for tenant-specific defaults.
- Removed the manager master’s duplicate notification and light/dark theme
  handlers; the shared bundled layout module is now the single owner of those
  interactions.
- Rebuilt the frontend, recompiled Blade views, and verified the complete
  suite still passes (**183/183 tests, 681 assertions**).
- Audited the manager master against the shared `resources/js/super-admin/layout.js`
  implementation before removing duplicate inline behavior. Removed the
  mobile navigation, active-link scrolling, header page search, manager
  navigation grouping, and delete-confirmation wiring scripts while preserving
  the confirmation modal markup and manager new-order listener.
- Confirmed the super-admin and CEO masters do not contain duplicate scripts
  for those categories; their remaining script hooks are the theme bootstrap
  and normal `@stack('scripts')` contract.
- The manager master decreased from the supplied 857-line baseline to 670
  lines, a reduction of 187 lines. The current file is 56,027 bytes.
- Browser validation confirmed bundled mobile navigation open/close, header
  search results, navigation grouping markup, active-link initialization, and
  delegated confirmation modal cancel behavior. Vite, Blade cache compilation,
  diagnostics, and the complete suite all pass (**183/183 tests, 681
  assertions**).
- Confirmed the super-admin master does not currently contain dead
  `x-super-admin.*` comment blocks in the active branch; the include-based shell
  (`sidebar`, `header`, `footer`) is the verified source of truth, and no legacy
  dead code remains to remove there.
- Audited the remaining Customer inline assets and confirmed the active inline
  `<style>` and `<script>` blocks are intentional shell/template logic (customer
  app shell theme vars, analytics consent, confirmation modal, password toggle,
  storefront hero/cart behavior) rather than stale dead code. The PDF/receipt
  export views remain intentionally standalone and were excluded from the app
  shell audit.
- Added `AuthorizationAndTenantIsolationTest` covering Super Admin, CEO,
  Manager, and Customer route boundaries; guessed cross-tenant menu-item IDs;
  Super Admin impersonation enter/exit; Manager impersonation denial; and
  disabled/enabled module route behavior.
- Fixed `Tenancy::end()` so exiting a no-database impersonation also clears the
  container-bound restaurant context. This restores a genuinely tenant-less
  Super Admin context instead of leaving stale tenant state in the process.
- Fixed order tracking to bind the resolved order restaurant before rendering
  the customer layout, so tracking pages consistently render the correct
  restaurant branding after a cross-restaurant lookup.
- Focused authorization, tenancy, menu-module, and checkout tests pass.
  The complete suite now passes: **191/191 tests, 702 assertions**.
- Rebuilt the Vite production assets successfully.
- Seeded deterministic browser-verification users and tenant data with
  `TestUserSeeder`, including an active, publicly discoverable storefront.
- Completed live browser verification of the first five core flows:
  Super Admin login/dashboard; business creation and edit persistence;
  Manager login/dashboard with tenant context; module visibility and direct
  route blocking; and menu/product create, edit, and delete.
- Completed the customer/order flow: the storefront loaded, the seeded
  product was added to the cart, checkout was submitted, and the application
  redirected to the order-tracking page with an order-placed confirmation.
- Verified the Manager subscription page shows the seeded Starter plan with
  Active status, monthly billing, and the expected next-invoice details.
- Verified Manager account settings save successfully and persist after the
  page reload.
- Created a browser-verification notification in the Manager workspace,
  confirmed it appeared in the list, and confirmed the mark-as-read action
  returned the expected success message.

### Medical Module Expansion — Phase 1

- Added tenant-scoped `Doctor` and `Patient` models using
  `BelongsToRestaurant`, with central and tenant migrations.
- Added Manager CRUD routes and controllers under `manager.doctors.*` and
  `manager.patients.*`, gated by the existing `module:medical` middleware.
- Added Manager pages under `resources/views/manager/doctors/` and
  `resources/views/manager/patients/`, extending
  `manager.layout.master` and defining `page-content`.
- Doctor statuses are restricted to `pending`, `active`, and `declined`.
- Patient creation/update checks the current tenant's existing patients by
  name or phone and rejects likely duplicate records.
- Phase 1 intentionally excludes queue, tokens, visits, check-in,
  allergy/interaction checks, billing, and all other Phase 2+ work.
- Focused Phase 1 tests pass: **3/3 tests, 12 assertions**.
- The complete suite passes: **197/197 tests, 734 assertions**.
- Blade view compilation and the Vite production build pass.
- Live browser verification on the current Test Restaurant tenant confirmed
  Doctor and Patient index/create pages load successfully after enabling the
  medical module and applying the new migrations. A Doctor and Patient were
  created through the browser, the Patient appeared in the index, and a
  duplicate Patient submission was rejected with the expected validation
  message.
- Confirmed the existing Super Admin-to-business module path: enabling
  `medical` on a business makes the existing medical routes available to its
  Manager accounts, while disabling it returns `403`. Added a regression test
  for this boundary.
- Implemented the approved Patient identity follow-up: CNIC is the strongest
  tenant-scoped identifier, no-CNIC matching uses name + phone + date of birth,
  and shared guardian phones never merge Patient records.
- Added dependent/guardian fields and exact relationship validation to the
  Patient CRUD flow, including the dependent-only form block and adult CNIC
  recommendation.
- Added the central and tenant follow-up migrations for CNIC, dependent and
  guardian fields, nullable contact phone, and the tenant-scoped CNIC
  uniqueness constraint.
- Patient identity tests pass: **6/6 tests, 33 assertions**; the full suite
  passes **202/202 tests, 753 assertions**, Blade compilation passes, and the
  Vite production build passes.

### Hospital staff-role addition and future scope documentation

- Added the plain-string `staff_type` field to the existing `User`-backed
  Manager Staff flow; the existing account `role` field remains unchanged.
- The approved initial staff-type list is exactly `nurse`, `guard`,
  `receptionist`, and `pharmacist`, validated with `Rule::in()`.
- Added the staff-type selector to Manager Staff create/edit pages and the
  staff listing.
- Added focused staff-role tests: create/update and invalid-value rejection.
- Added the documentation-only
  **Hospital-Specific Extensions (Full Hospital Management Scope — Future
  Initiative)** section to the medical expansion plan. It is explicitly
  excluded from approved Phase 1–5 implementation and requires separate
  approval.
- Staff-role tests, related Doctor/Patient tests, Blade compilation, and the
  Vite production build pass.

### Pending Work

All eight core browser flows are now verified:

1. Super Admin login/dashboard — passed.
2. Business creation/settings — passed; creation succeeded and the edited
   address persisted after reload.
3. Manager login/dashboard — passed with the expected Test Restaurant context.
4. Module access/role restrictions — passed; the disabled POS route returned
   403 and unavailable navigation was hidden.
5. Menu/product management — passed; create, edit, and delete all succeeded.
6. Customer/order flow — passed; storefront browse, cart, checkout, and order
   placement redirected to tracking successfully.
7. Subscription/billing status — passed; Starter plan and Active monthly status
   matched the seeded tenant.
8. Notifications/account settings — passed; notification creation and
   mark-as-read succeeded, and account changes persisted after reload.

The stabilization and verification gate is complete. New feature work may now
begin, subject to the route, permission, tenant-boundary, and validation
requirements above.

### Phase 3 UI Convention

Manager medical action and print links use the shared Blade icon components
(`x-icons.*`) with accessible text labels. Consultation screens show a clear
warning when the patient has active clinical allergies.

### Follow-up Bug Fixes

- Fixed the customer tracking-page duplicate card at the shell composition
  boundary. `customer.layout.header` already owns the customer content wrapper
  and `@yield('page-content')`; the master was yielding the same section a
  second time. The lookup page now renders exactly one tracking card.
- Added a regression test for the single customer tracking form and a module
  regression test confirming that a manager with inherited access immediately
  reflects modules enabled or disabled on the business by Super Admin.
- Smoothed the dashboard sidebar gradient by removing the abrupt three-stop
  color reversal and using a controlled midpoint blend.
- Reworked dark-mode shell tokens and overrides to grayscale (near-black
  surfaces, white/light-gray text, gray borders, and contrast-based active
  states) across dashboard and customer shells. Customer pages now initialize
  from the shared dashboard theme preference as well.
- Targeted regression tests pass (**10/10**), the Vite production build passes,
  edited files report no diagnostics, and the complete suite passes:
  **193/193 tests, 708 assertions**.

### Super Admin View Reorganization

The Super Admin page views now use this mapping without changing route names or
URLs:

- `super-admin.restaurants.{index,create,edit,manager-access,ceo-access}` →
  `super-admin.businesses.{index,create,edit,manager-access,ceo-access}`
- `super-admin.restaurants._homepage_fields` →
  `super-admin.businesses._homepage_fields`
- `super-admin.restaurants._module-plan-script` →
  `super-admin.businesses._module-plan-script`
- `super-admin.feedback-centre.{index,show}` references were corrected to the
  existing `super-admin.feedback.{index,show}` views.
- Existing `business-types`, `modules`, `subscription-plans`, `feedback`,
  `notifications`, `account`, and `platform-settings` folders were retained;
  `layout/` was not changed.

The module-access divergence was fixed: `User::hasModuleAccess()` now uses
business-level enablement as the single source of truth for restaurant admins,
Managers, and Super Admin impersonation. The root cause was that direct Manager
logins applied the legacy `module_access` narrowing list, while impersonated
Super Admin sessions bypassed it. Legacy per-manager selections are retained for
compatibility, but enabled business modules now produce the same access result
through either login path; disabled business modules remain blocked.

The direct Manager login regression is covered by a comparison test that checks
both module decisions and rendered sidebar items against Super Admin
impersonation. The seeded Test Restaurant Manager now inherits the full enabled
business module set. Verification passed: **388/388 tests, 0 failures**; the
direct Manager browser session rendered Restaurant POS, Operations, Sales, Menu,
Money, Staff, Account, and Reports for Test Restaurant.

### Final UI verification closure

- Live browser verification completed for the medical Staff Type branch by
  temporarily assigning the existing Test Restaurant tenant the existing
  `Clinic / Doctor` BusinessType, opening Manager → Add Staff, and confirming
  the dropdown rendered exactly Nurse, Guard, Receptionist, and Pharmacist.
  The tenant was then restored to its original `Restaurant` BusinessType; no
  staff or business records were created or deleted.
- The complementary live Restaurant check remained confirmed: after restore,
  the Staff Type field was hidden on the same Add Staff page.
- CEO and Customer views were cross-checked against
  `docs/CEO_VIEW_STRUCTURE.md` and `docs/CUSTOMER_VIEW_STRUCTURE.md`. CEO has
  executive dashboards, business/branch detail, reports, alerts, and profile
  pages; Customer has storefront, checkout/tracking, feedback, and account
  pages. Neither role contains a data-table page with an Actions column, so
  there were no CEO/Customer table actions omitted from the icon conversion.

### Test Restaurant medical regression follow-up

- Repaired the Test Restaurant tenant's missing local `restaurants` mirror
  row using the established non-destructive `syncRestaurantMirror()` path.
  This restored the tenant-local foreign-key target required by `doctors`.
- Added the missing tenant `appointments` table migration
  (`2026_09_12_200000_create_appointments_table.php`) and applied it to tenant
  15 without a reset or `migrate:fresh`.
- Re-fetched QueueEntry and Visit records inside the active tenant context in
  queue-print and consultation actions, fixing route-binding relationship
  resolution for Doctor and Patient.
- Browser regression verified Doctor creation, Patient creation and duplicate
  rejection, queue token issuance, queue advance/start, consultation
  completion, diagnosis/notes persistence, and consultation printing.
- Fixed prescription submission when the optional `medicines` field is absent;
  the controller now treats it as an empty selection instead of raising an
  undefined-array-key error.
- Expanded the Manager prescription form with Visit, Patient, Doctor, and
  tenant medicine fields so the existing allergy and interaction checks can be
  exercised from the UI. The focused Phase 3 suite passes **4/4 tests**, and
  the Vite production build passes.
- The browser session became unauthenticated during the prescription submit
  navigation, so prescription persistence, safety rejection, and prescription
  printing remain pending live verification. Phase 4 dispensing is not yet
  approved.
- The focused Phase 3 tests pass **4/4**. A subsequent fresh full-suite run
  initially exposed an idempotency failure in `TenantProvisioningTest`;
  guarding the existing tenant `restaurant_id` columns fixed the root cause.
  The current complete result is **210/210 tests passing**.
- After removing implicit route-model binding from prescription show/print
  actions, the live prescription flow is complete: an unconflicted
  prescription persisted and appeared in the list, an active patient allergy
  produced the expected rejection warning, and the printable prescription
  slip rendered real patient/doctor/date data. Phase 4 remains pending
  product approval, not blocked by this regression.

### Phase 4 — prescription dispensing foundation

- Added tenant and central dispensing metadata (`dispensed_by`,
  `dispensed_at`) to prescriptions.
- Added a medical dispense action for verified prescriptions. Managers and
  admins are operational overrides; staff users must have `staff_type` set to
  `pharmacist`.
- The action
  consumes non-expired `MedicineBatch` stock in expiry order inside a
  transaction, rejects insufficient stock without marking the prescription
  used, and records the authenticated dispenser and timestamp.
- Added focused coverage for successful stock deduction, insufficient-stock
  rollback, expired-batch exclusion, expiry-order consumption, repeat
  dispensing protection, authorization boundaries, and pharmacist
  authorization.
- Added transactional prescription-row locking so concurrent dispense
  requests cannot fulfill the same prescription twice.
- Live verification initially exposed a tenant schema boundary bug: the
  tenant `prescriptions.dispensed_by` column incorrectly had a foreign key to
  tenant-local `users`, while authenticated users are central records. The
  tenant FK was removed non-destructively; the audit ID column remains and the
  central migration retains its central-user FK.
- Browser verification then succeeded with real Test Restaurant data:
  prescription `RX-BROWSER-001` changed to `Used`, recorded dispenser ID 19
  and timestamp, and reduced the prepared batch from 3 to 2 units.
- Focused medical and notification suite: **22/22 passing**.
  Fresh full suite after the schema repair: **219/219 passing, 845
  assertions**. Vite production build:
  **passed**. Phase 4 dispensing validation is complete.

### Phase 5 — queue display hardening

- Added `no-store` response headers to the public queue-token and kiosk
  display pages so shared screens and browsers do not cache queue status.
- Preserved the existing privacy boundary: public pages expose only the
  doctor, token, queue date/status, and no patient or medical information.
- Queue display regression coverage passes, including privacy assertions and
  cache-header verification.
- Browser verification completed on Test Restaurant for both
  `/queue-display/test-restaurant` and the public token page: both rendered
  successfully with doctor/token/status-only content, exposed no patient
  names or medical data, and returned `Cache-Control:
  max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-cache, no-store, private`.
- Added matching 10-second meta refresh to the individual public token page,
  so patients see queue status changes without manually reloading.
- Added an explicit `Refresh now` control and a local `Last checked` time on
  both public queue screens for users who need an immediate status check.
- Added a provider-independent `QueueNotificationService` message builder for
  future SMS/WhatsApp delivery. Its called-token message contains only the
  token and doctor name; patient identity and medical details are excluded.
- Added the first real delivery pipeline slice: Manager-side tenant opt-in and
  SMS/WhatsApp channel selection, patient phone consent captured at check-in,
  tenant-aware queued delivery jobs with standard retries/backoff, and a
  log-only provider bound behind a `NotificationProvider` contract.
- Notifications remain safely disabled by default. Dispatch requires both
  tenant opt-in/channel enablement and patient consent; the default provider
  records a privacy-safe message in the application log and makes no external
  call.
- Final validation for this Phase 5 slice: **220/220 tests passing, 847
  assertions**, Vite production build **passed**, and changed-file
  diagnostics reported no errors.
- Added regression coverage proving medical report KPIs are date-filtered and
  isolated to the authenticated tenant. The latest focused medical suite
  passes **14/14 tests, 95 assertions**, and the complete suite remains green.
- The new delivery-pipeline focused tests pass after the tenant schema was
  applied to Test Restaurant. A real provider (Twilio, WhatsApp Business API,
  or another approved service) still must be selected and configured before
  enabling delivery for real patients.
- Added an explicit `medical_queue_notifications.driver` configuration key
  (default `log`) and terminal failure logging from the queued job, so
  provider outages remain visible through normal Laravel failed-job handling.
- Added a Twilio adapter behind the existing `NotificationProvider` contract
  for SMS and WhatsApp, using Laravel's HTTP client and environment-based
  credentials. The default driver remains `log`; live delivery is not enabled
  until sender approval, sandbox testing, and production credential review are
  complete.
- Improved the existing Manager medical reports landing page with real
  tenant-scoped date-filtered KPIs for patients, doctors, visits,
  prescriptions, dispensing, and today's active queue; removed placeholder
  dash values without creating a second reporting system.
- Live browser verification confirmed the Manager medical notification page
  renders with opt-in/SMS/WhatsApp controls, and Patient Check-In renders an
  unchecked consent checkbox with the phone-number consent explanation.
- Kept this foundation in the Manager medical workflow and tenant scope.
  Super Admin should only receive future platform/provider configuration
  controls; business opt-in and recipient preferences belong to each
  Manager-side tenant workflow.

### Queue notification provider readiness record

#### Implemented

- Tenant opt-in and enabled-channel selection for SMS and WhatsApp.
- Patient phone-number consent captured during medical check-in.
- Privacy-safe queue-called message builder.
- Tenant-aware queued job with Laravel retry/backoff behavior.
- `NotificationProvider` contract with a log driver and a Twilio adapter.
- Twilio SMS and WhatsApp request formatting covered by HTTP-fake tests.
- Tenant-scoped delivery audit records now track queued, sent, and terminal
  failed status, provider message ID, timestamps, masked recipient, and
  sanitized failure text without storing medical details.
- Repaired the dispensing tenant migration to check for the foreign key
  constraint idempotently across MySQL and SQLite, allowing all tenant
  databases and provisioning tests to migrate safely.
- Added a Manager delivery-history page with status filtering. It shows only
  queue token, doctor, channel, masked recipient, status, and sent time; it
  does not expose patient identity, message content, or failure details.
- Live delivery remains disabled because the configured default is
  `MEDICAL_QUEUE_NOTIFICATION_DRIVER=log`.

#### Pending before live patient delivery

1. Confirm the approved provider: Twilio SMS, Twilio WhatsApp, Meta WhatsApp
   Business API, or an approved local SMS gateway.
2. Create and verify the provider account, sender identity, templates, and
   destination-country support.
3. Rotate any credential that has ever been placed in a local `.env` file or
   shared during development; keep secrets only in environment variables or a
   production secrets manager.
4. Configure production credentials and sender values without committing them,
   then keep the driver set to `log` until sandbox tests pass.
5. Test sandbox numbers for successful delivery, invalid numbers, provider
   rejection, timeout, retry, and terminal failure logging.
6. Obtain final consent/privacy approval for the message wording, retention,
   channel policy, and patient opt-out process.
7. Add delivery-status persistence and operational monitoring before enabling
   live traffic.
8. Change the production driver to `twilio` only after the preceding checks
   are signed off; never enable it for real patients as part of local testing.

#### Recommended next implementation slice

Run provider sandbox tests before enabling live traffic. Keep provider
credentials outside the database and do not store unnecessary medical
information in the audit record.
